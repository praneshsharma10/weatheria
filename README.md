## Snippet

Here's a quick look at the `fetchWeather` function used in the app to retrieve weather data:

```javascript
const fetchWeather = async (unitParam = unit) => {
  const apiKey = import.meta.env.VITE_WEATHER_API_KEY;
  const response = await fetch(`https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q=${city}&appid=${apiKey}&units=${unitParam}`);
  const data = await response.json();
  setWeatherData(data);
};
```
